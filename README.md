# Fall Detection System

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Human Activity Recognition with Mobile Sensing](https://www.kaggle.com/code/malekzadeh/human-activity-recognition-with-mobile-sensing).

## Overview
The Fall Detection System is a mobile health technology designed for elderly care, focusing on detecting falls and recognizing activities. This application leverages smartphone sensors to provide real-time alerts to caregivers or emergency contacts, thereby improving safety and reducing response times for fall incidents.

## Features
- **Fall Detection**: Utilizes built-in smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to detect falls.
- **Activity Recognition**: Monitors various activities to differentiate between normal and abnormal behavior.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Sends immediate notifications to caregivers or emergency contacts in case of a fall.
